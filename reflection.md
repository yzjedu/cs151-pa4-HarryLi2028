* In this PA I learned to use files and change between them throughout the code effectively. I also learned how to understand better storing them into a list and returning them through functions. Throughout the PA I would say the hardest was understanding what to create for functions and planning what to write for each function. Other than that everything else was somewhat smooth. I first wrote my functions and saw what I needed to write for each of then turned it into code. After that, I tested the code and see if there were any problems. The coding sometimes gave me a hard time including knowing what was written into my files and reading through the files. On average that function took more time than my other functions but everything else was fine or just had minor errors.
